# The Royal Game of Ur

This is an antique game played thousands years ago and it is the oldest playable
game known.

There are several rules described by several experts but I based this program on
this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I).

# The code

The code is currently a playable version of the game in console written in
python. You can play against a really dumb bot for now or you can look two bots
playing against one another.

# Goal of the project

The goal is first to create an advanced IA (probably based on MIN-MAX) and then
to create a more graphical interface.
Maybe I will then implement the other set of rules.

# Usage

There is not other dependencies than Python >= 3.5. Launch it using
`$ /path/to/python3 main.py`. Then it is pretty obvious. Use the keyboard to
answer the questions.
